A gentle introduction to Isabelle and Isabelle/HOL

When I started to use Isabelle some years ago I had no background in formal proof systems other than a basic knowledge of mathematical logics. I found it very challenging to understand what the system does and how it is used. The extensive documentation (which I appreciate a lot in the meantime) was of limited help at the beginning: it is spread across several documents and it is either oriented towards specific applications (the tutorials about program semantics) or requires profound knowledge of proof systems for understanding (the reference manual etc). It did not provide the orientation I needed for a thorough insight into the *language* used to write theories and proofs.

At some point I started to turn my notes into a document and later decided that it may be useful for others as well, if it covers a substantial part of Isabelle and Isabelle/HOL. So I revised and extended it, while having fun in exploring the features of Isabelle and Isabelle/HOL. The document became much larger than intended. 

As an introductory manual it explains how to work with Isabelle to develop
mathematical models. It does not presume prior knowledge about formal
or informal proof techniques. It only assumes that the reader has a basic
understanding of mathematical logics and the task of proving mathematical
propositions.

The document is not a tutorial for working with examples. Instead, it describes the concepts and the language used to input mathematical
models to Isabelle, beginning with the most basic concepts and then proceeding to more eloborate concepts.

Have fun.
